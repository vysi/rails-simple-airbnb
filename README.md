Example rails app with one `Flat` model.

- As a user, I can see all the available flats on our website
- As a user, I can post a flat to the website, specifying its name and address
- As a user, I can see detailed information of a given flat, including a nice little map if I get lost ðŸ˜Š
- As a user, I can edit the details of a flat if I made a mistake
- As a user, I can delete a flat from the website, in case I don't want to rent it anymore
